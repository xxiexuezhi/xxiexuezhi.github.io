My first significant computational work regarding my phd study. We have developed a model using Wasserstein bidirectional GAN architecture to produce physically reasonable novel helical structures at atomic resolution, and demonstrated a MCMC search mechanism to optimize those helices for desired structural properties

>Abstract: <br/>Protein engineering has become an important field in biomedicine with application in therapeutics, diagnostics and synthetic biology. Due to the complexity of protein structure computational design remains a difficult problem. As helices are an abundant structural feature and play a vital role in determination of the protein structure, full computational design for helices would be an important first step. Here, we apply Wasserstein bi-directional Generative Adversarial Networks to generate the full atom helical structures, and we also introduce a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo searching mechanism with the encoder to design the desired helices matching the target "hotspot" residues structures.  Our model completed  70.9% testcases by generating the desired helices within 3 A RMSD compared with target hotspots. We demonstrate that our approach is able to quickly generate structurally plausible solutions, bringing us closer to the final goal of fast computational protein design.
