>Abstract: <br/>The  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  system  or  complex  playsan  irreplaceable  role  in  regulating  the  humansâ€™  immune  system.  Accurate prediction  of  peptide  binding  with  HLA  can  efficiently  promote  to  identify those  neoantigens,  which  potentially  make  a  great  change  in  immune  drug development. HLA is one of the most polymorphic genetic systems in humans,and thousands of HLA allelic versions exist. Due to the high polymorphism of HLA complex, it is still pretty difficult to accurately predict the binding affinity. In  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  novel  algorithm  which combined  convolutional neural network and long short-term memory to solve this problem. Our model has  been  tested  with  the  experimental benchmark from IEDB and shows the state-of-the-art performance compared with other currently popular algorithms
