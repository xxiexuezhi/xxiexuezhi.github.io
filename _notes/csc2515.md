>Abstract: <br/>This is an introductory grad course on machine learning. Machine learning is a set of techniques that allow machines to learn from data and experience, rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behavior by hand. Over the past two decades, machine learning techniques have become increasingly central both in AI as an academic field, and in the technology industry. This course provides a broad introduction to some of the most commonly used ML algorithms.
