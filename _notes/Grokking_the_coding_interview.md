>Abstract: <br/>This course categorizes coding interview problems into a set of 16 patterns. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques. We will make use of Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search to solve problems related to Trees and Graphs. Similarly, we will also cover Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Recursion, Greedy algorithms, and Divide & Conquer.
