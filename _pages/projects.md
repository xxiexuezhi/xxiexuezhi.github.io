* Deep generative model with constraints for peptide structural design           (Jan.2019 - now)
  *Developed a deep generative model for novel dextrorotary helical conformations to facilitate the peptide drug design.
  *Developed and implemented various MCMC searches to optimize the synthetic data with optimized pharmetutical properties. Published the work as first author in NeuIPS Workshop (MLSB) 2021. [Link for my talk]( https://recorder-v3.slideslive.com/?share=54078&s=518da677-492e-4627-96ce-c0190976326c)

* Cell detection application for pathological image analysis                  (Jan.2019 - April.2020)
  *Designed and developed customized object detection algorithms to detect brain cells and mitosis cells on pathology segmented images and whole slide images by using deep Convolutional  Neural  Network.
  *Designed and developed Ki-67 cell segmentation and detection algorithm based on cellpose  and image classification.

* Recommendation system for  prediction of user purchase behavior             (Jan. 2019 - Mar.2019) 
  *Classified data as train sets, validation sets and test sets. Constructed features using Pandas. Dealt with positive and negative sample imbalances using k-means and subsample.
  *Used the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree to predict user purchase behavior through model training, parameter tuning and performance evaluation using F1-Score. Ranked 4th in 135 submission teams ([Kaggle leaderboard link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/csc2515-rating-prediction/leaderboard))

* Data Mining for Twitter Unstructured Data                                   (Sep.2018 - Dec.2018)
  *Mining interesting information from twitter tweets (JSON). Operated complex and unstructured data using MongoDB. Used MapReduce to process and summarize information.  Conducted ElasticSearch. Visualized the information using Kibana.
