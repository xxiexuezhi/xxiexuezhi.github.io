I'm [a 2nd-year cs phd student at Kim's lab](https://www.kimlab.org/members/people) in University of Toronto focusing on machine learning area.

---

machine learning has achieved rapid progress in many areasdue to its ability to understanding the comprehensive relationships between multiple interdependent variables. My research applies a wide range of deep learning approaches to better understand protein structure and function. I believe that the ability to design proteins shows our understanding of biology.

Over the past three years, I have developed several deep learning models for computational biology including CNN, LSTM, transformers, and deep generative model using Keras and Pytorch. Models have been demonstrated state-of-art performance, and papers are available in [publication section](https://xxiexuezhi.github.io/publications/).

<!-- 
Over the past few years, I have transitioned most of my computational research from a C-and-Matlab two-language workflow (C for heavy lifting / parallel work, and Matlab everything else) to a pure [Julia](https://julialang.org/) workflow, using [MPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl) for most parallel/HPC work, along with packages like [LoopVectoriztion.jl](https://github.com/chriselrod/LoopVectorization.jl) and [VectorizedRNG.jl](https://github.com/chriselrod/VectorizedRNG.jl) for SIMD performance. I have written up a few [notes](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/JuliaAdviceForMatlabProgrammers) of advice for anyone else who is interested in doing the same. The short version: efficient _multiple dispatch_ really does provide a solution to the "two-language problem", but the dispatch-centric programming paradigm can take quite a while to fully internalize; beware _type instability_.

For mineral (especially zircon) eruption/deposition age estimation, there is a simple example in this [BayeZirChron demo notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/brenhinkeller/BayeZirChron.c/main?filepath=julia%2Fdemo.ipynb) based on [Keller, Schoene, & Samperton (2018)]( https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1826), or the [Chron.jl](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/Chron.jl) version of the same notebook:

* Standalone eruption/deposition age modelling

While originally developed for zircon eruption age estimation, an analagous approach is also applicable to plutonic settings (e.g., [Ratschbacher et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egy079)), or to the problem of finding the distribution of the limits of a highly dispersed mineral crystallization (or closure) age spectrum more broadly.

Other [Chron.jl](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/Chron.jl) example notebooks demonstrate the integration of this eruption/deposition approach with age-depth modelling, or standalone age-depth models.

* Coupled eruption-age and age-depth modelling

* Age-depth modelling with radiocarbon age constraints

If you're interested in "statistical geochemistry", especially weighted bootstrap resampling of whole-rock geochemical data, try [StatGeochem.jl](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatGeochem.jl) (Julia), or else [StatisticalGeochemistry](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatisticalGeochemistry) (Matlab, no longer actively developed). A number of example usage notebooks are available in the StatGeochem.jl repo, including
