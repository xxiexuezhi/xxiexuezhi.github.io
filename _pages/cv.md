Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2020 - 2024 (expected)
* M.S. in Computer Science, specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Western University, 2018 - 2020
* B.S. in Biology, Minor in Computer science, University of Waterloo, 2012 - 2016

Work experience
======
* Research assistant (machine learning) - University of Toronto, Toronto, On, Canada, 2020 - present
  * Developed a deep generative model for novel dextrorotary helical conformations to facilitate the peptide drug design.
  * Developed and implemented various MCMC searches to optimize the synthetic data with optimized pharmetutical properties. Published the work as first author in NeuIPS Workshop (MLSB) 2021.
  * Pre-trained a graph convolutional network to reconstruct masked amino acids in proteins
  * Supervisor: Professor Philip M. Kim

* AI developer & Research assistant  - Kaizhong’s lab, Western University,  London, On, Canada, Sep.2018 - Apr. 2020
  * Collected peptide data from online databases (IEDB, IPD-MHC). Preprocessed, and analyzed data by using PySpark
  * Implemented and compared decision tree- and neural network-based models for predicting peptide binding.
  * Designed and developed a novel CNN-LSTM model to solve a mhc-ligand binding classification task. Achieved state of the art performance (AUC : 92.3%).
  * Published the work as first author in IEEE-BIBM (2019) and  IJDMB(2020).
